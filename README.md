## Description

Welcome to the NASA Mars Rover Photo Viewer! This web application connects to the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/) to fetch photos from various Mars rovers. Users can explore captivating images captured by rovers such as Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit. Let's dive into the key features and functionalities of the app:

## Features

- Browse Mars Rover Photos: Explore a vast collection of photos taken by the Mars rovers Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit.
- Pagination: Photos are displayed in pages, with a maximum of 25 photos per page, making it easy to navigate through the extensive photo archive.
- Camera Filters: Users can apply filters to view photos taken by a specific camera on the rovers.
- Latest Photos by Default: Upon launching the app, users are greeted with the latest photos taken on the current day.
- Search by Earth Day Date: Users have the option to search for photos based on a specific Earth Day date (e.g., 2020-09-22).
- Search by Sol Date: Users can also search for photos based on the Martian "Sol" date (e.g., 2890).
- Test Coverage: The project includes a suite of tests to ensure the app functions reliably and consistently.
- Favorite Searches: Users can save their favorite search parameters as bookmarks, which can be recalled in the future. The app supports local storage for saving these bookmarks.
